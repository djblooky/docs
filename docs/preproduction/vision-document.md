# The Vision Document

The vision document (sometimes called the pitch document) is essentially a condensed and more to-the-point version of a game design document. It's exactly what it sounds like, it serves to clarify the *vision* of your game to the reader so that they are able to quickly understand the most important aspects. This document can be an key part of getting people to invest in your game that goes hand in hand with [the pitch](https://charlie.games/gamedev-workflow-docs/the-pitch), whether it be investing with money, time, or valuable insight.

## Document Structure

The style and structure you choose to outline your document with matters less than the actual information, because format tends to vary from one developer/publisher to the next. Below is an example of vision documents and how you may want to organize them:

## The Information to Outline

To start, let's walk through some of the information you might want to include in this document that is most important to know about your game. 

### The Key Info 

At the very top of the vision document, you will want to include some bullet points or a short section with the most relevent information. 

* **Game Name**
* **Genre** - 3D Action/FPS? 2D Puzzle platformer?
* **Platform** - iOS, PC, WebGL...
* **Controls/Input** - WASD, touch screen...

Here are some other things that might be worth mentioning, depending on the project:

* **Target Audience** - age range or specific demographic?
* **Engine** - Unity Engine, Unreal Engine, Twine, etc
* **Number of Players** - single player, 4-person co-op, etc

Also note that games of particular platforms or genres may require additional specifics. For instance, you would want to specify an aspect ratio and device orientation for a mobile game. 

### High Level Concept 

This is a basic overview description of the core gameplay elements and key info.

Diablo I (famous for its looting system) has a good example of this kind of overview:

> *Diablo is a role playing game wherein a player creates a single character and guides him through a dungeon in an attempt to find and destroy 'Diablo', the devil himself. All the action takes place in an isometric, three-quarter perspective, with diamond-shaped, 'square' floor spaces (see diagram).*

### Gamplay Overview

This section should describe how to play your game and what the player will be doing to progress. The reader should be able to fully understand the gameplay 

* Controls
* Core game-loop
* Main mechanic(s)
* Progression
* Win/lose conditions

### Walkthrough

 Imagine a walkthrough you'd read online when you get stuck in a game. It tells you the critical path, explains the moment to moment gameplay. Maybe even has some light maps or other visual aids. This forces the designer to really visualize how the game works in concrete terms. Do a walkthrough for a potential puzzle or typical section of gameplay.
